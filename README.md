You will need a `names.csv` to get started - it should a file with a long list
of comma separated names you can start the ratings with. Due to dumb hardcoding
make sure to add `noah`, `nick`, `allen`, `chanhee`, and `jack`.

It should look something like...

`noah,nick,allen,chanhee,jack...`

## TODO

- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Use a real databse
- [ ] Refactor code so its less copy-pasty
- [ ] Use a real server (not the flask development server)
